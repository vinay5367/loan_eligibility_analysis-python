# Loan Eligibility Analysis

**Loan Eligibility Analysis**

Analyzed loan application data to identify the key factors influencing loan approval decisions and provide actionable recommendations to improve targeting and risk management.

## Project overview

This repository contains the analysis and supporting files for a Loan Eligibility Analysis project. The goal is to uncover patterns in applicant data that influence loan approvals and to deliver clear, data-backed recommendations for lending strategy.

**Tech stack:** Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook, Excel

---

## Key highlights

- Performed exploratory and statistical analyses across 600+ loan applications to identify high-impact approval drivers.
- Found that applicants with strong credit history had ~80% approval rates versus <20% for weak credit history, and high loan-to-income ratios increased rejection likelihood **3 to 4 times**.
- Delivered actionable recommendations for customer targeting and decisioning improvements.

## Contents of the analysis

- Data overview: summary statistics and distribution checks.
- Exploratory analysis: univariate, bivariate and multivariate analyses to identify patterns and relationships.
- Feature engineering: created derived features (e.g., income aggregates, ratios, duration in years) to improve interpretability.
- Insight generation: quantified impact of high-level predictors on approval outcomes.
- Recommendations: business-focused actions for improving targeting and reducing risk.


## Business findings & Recommendations

**Findings**
- Credit history emerged as the strongest indicator of approval â€” applicants with strong credit history had ~80% approval rates vs. <20% otherwise.
- High loan-to-income ratios were strongly associated with rejections, increasing rejection likelihood 3 to 4 times.

**Recommendations**
- Prioritize applicants with strong credit signals when creating marketing or pre-approval offers.

- Introduce automated screening thresholds using loan-to-income bands to reduce manual reviews and improve turnaround.

- Consider tailored product terms or pricing for applicants with borderline risk profiles to expand approval coverage without increasing portfolio risk.
